## User Story

As a user,
I want to record all the medications I require,
So I know when and how much to take each medication each day.

## Description

MedicationMe is an application that allows users to create their own account, and record all the medications they need to take and for how long. Users will be able to record the name of the medication, time they need to take it, how long they need to take it for, their dosage and any further instructions required. They will be greeted with the medications for the day, and any meds upcoming.
